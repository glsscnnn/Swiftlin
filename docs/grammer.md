# Gammer Explained

So what is a grammar? Grammar is the way in which we define the underlying structure of a program. Similar to how grammar works in language we can break down sentences to semantically analyze them. For example: [I have a pen.] "I" is the subject "have" is the action "a" is a numerical identifier, and "pen" is the object that is being acted upon, by the action of "have" the period at the end indicates the end of the sentence. Similarly you can break down a program statement in the same way instead of object, action and subject in programing we use something called a token; what a token is, is something that tells us what a word, operator, or number means which is logically equivalent to the action, subject and object ideas in linguistics. So for example in Java:

```java
System.out.println("Hello");
```

Here what we see is that there is a keyword, this keyword ``System`` is an object with attributes ``.out.println`` that is acting upon the contents of the container ``("")`` by telling those contents to output to the console the contents of that continer are of type string as indicated by ``""`` the string itself reads ``Hello`` which is output to the console, the ``;`` indicates the end of the statement similar to a period.
