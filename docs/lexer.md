# Lexical Anylisis

The way that we're going to do this is by modeling how each grammer works using a FSM (Finite State Machine) This is going to be hard and I don't really understand or know how this is going to work yet but maybe something like this please message me if you think there is a better way:

``` python

def mult(a, b):
    return a * b

# definitionally what this does

def mult_2(a, b):
    if a, b in float:
        for i in range(b):
            a + a
    else:
        print("error")


```
